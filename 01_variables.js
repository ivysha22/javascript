//variables-provide a way to stor data as your application is running eg the current logged user, cart items,states etc
//in js we define/create variables using const, let or var keywords with a variable name, an assignmrnt operator and the value to be stored 


/* examples */

const user1 ="joseph";
let user2 ="Albert";
/* 
const and let are block scoped --- they are only accessible within a block{} of code
const is used for constant/non-changing variables 
let is used for variables whose values change as the program runs
*/
var email="albert@eldohub.co.ke";

/* changing values */

console.log(user2)

user2="Victor"

console.log(user2)

//console.log(user1)
//user1="sharon";/* error --you cannot change a value of a constant variable--this will bring an error */
//console.log(user1);


/* browser alerts --input/output */
/* const response=confirm("Do you want to exit this page?");
console.log(response);//a boolean  value true or false */
